BioSimulators-pyNeuroML documentation
=====================================

BioSimulators-pyNeuroML provides a `BioSimulators <https://biosimulators.org>`_-compliant command-line interface to the `pyNeuroML <https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML>`_ biological simulation tool. A Docker image for this package is also available.

This command-line interface and Docker image enable users to use pyNeuroML to execute `COMBINE/OMEX archives <https://combinearchive.org/>`_ that describe one or more simulation experiments (in `SED-ML format <https://sed-ml.org>`_) of one or more models (in `NeuroML format <https://neuroml.org/>`_).

A list of the algorithms and algorithm parameters supported by pyNeuroML is available at `BioSimulators <https://biosimulators.org/simulators/pyneuroml>`_.

A simple web application and web service for using pyNeuroML to execute COMBINE/OMEX archives is also available at `runBioSimulations <https://run.biosimulations.org>`_.
